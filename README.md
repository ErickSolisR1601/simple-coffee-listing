# ☕ Simple Coffee Listing

This project is a solution to the [Simple Coffee Listing](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/simple-coffee-listing) challenge from **DevChallenges.io**. The goal of this challenge was to create a coffee listing page that meets the requirements and design provided.  

## 🖥️ Project Description

In this project, I developed a cafe listing application using **React**. The main goal was to implement a reusable card component, handle dynamic data from an external source and allow users to filter products based on availability.  

## 🚀 Features  

- **Reusable components:**  
  A card component that includes image, name, price, rating and number of votes (if applicable). It also renders conditional labels such as “Popular” or “Not available”.  

- **External data consumption:**  
  The list of cafes is obtained from a mock JSON file or API.  

- **Dynamic filtering:**  
  Users can toggle between viewing all products or only those available.  

- **Adaptable design:**  
  The design adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience on mobile devices and desktop.
